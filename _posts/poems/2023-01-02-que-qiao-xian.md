### Original Poem

<poem_c>

华灯纵博，雕鞍驰射，谁记当年豪举。酒徒一半取封侯，独去作、江边渔父。
<br>
轻舟八尺，低篷三扇，占断苹洲烟雨。镜湖元自属闲人，又何必、官家赐与。
<br>

### Translation

<poem_e>
Remember those heroic years?
<br>
Loosing arrows on the finest mounts,
<br>
losing bets under the splendid lights.
<br>
<br>
Half us drunks rose up to lords.
<br>
But I alone remain,
<br>
fishing by the river.
<br>
<br>
Rowing through the mist, 
<br>
my little roof sits low above,
<br>
like the rain was meant for it.
<br>
<br>
Mirror lake is for the idle.
<br>
His majesty can give it, but
<br>
its beauty is already ours.

</poem_e>
