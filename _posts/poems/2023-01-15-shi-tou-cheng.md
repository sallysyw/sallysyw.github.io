### Original Poem

<poem_c>

山围故国周遭在，潮打空城寂寞回。
<br>
淮水东边旧时月，夜深还过女墙来。 
<br>
<br>
— 唐代 · 刘禹锡《金陵五题·石头城》
</poem_c>
<br>

### Translation

<poem_e>
The mountains shade the empty town, 
<br>
the tide knocks and goes lonely down.
<br>
<br>
The same moon shining on the Huai,  
<br>
in deepest night still climbs inside.
</poem_e>
<br>

### Note

[`金陵(Jinling)`](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%87%91%E9%99%B5%E5%9F%8E) is the ancient name of [`南京(Nanjing)`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing), In 229 A.D., [`孙权(Sun, Quan)`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Quan), the great emperor of Wu (in the three kingdoms era), established the capital here. Jinling rose from then on, and has long been a political, economic and cultural center of China.

_Stone City_ is located on Qingliang Mountain in the west of Nanjing City today. Sun, Quan built the city with stone walls during the Three Kingdoms period. Later generations always referred to it as Stone City, now it has become part of Nanjing.
