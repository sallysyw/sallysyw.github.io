### Original Poem

<poem_c>
朔风吹散三更雪，倩魂犹恋桃花月。
<br>
梦好莫催醒，由他好处行。
<br>
无端听画角，枕畔红冰薄。 
<br>
塞马一声嘶，残星拂大旗。
<br>
<br>

### Translation

<poem_e>
he meets his lover again as peach blossoms fall
<br>
and snowflakes cover the sky in a sharp winter squall
<br>
do not wake him
<br>
from the sweet memory of the life he has lost
<br>
and the tears on his face slowly turning to frost
<br>
but the bugle's call pierces the night
<br>
and he must go
<br>
for the standard waving through the cold starlight
<br>
and the horses neighing afar, ready to fight
</poem_e>

### Note

[`菩萨蛮`](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%8F%A9%E8%90%A8%E8%9B%AE) is one of the most famous
epigraph names of [`词`](https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E8%AF%8D_(%E6%96%87%E5%AD%A6)), originating from Tang Dynasty.

During the Emperor Xuan-Zong time of the Tang Dynasty, the Nǚ-Mán Kingdom sent envoys to pay tribute. They wore jewels and high buns, and they were known as the Pú-Sà(Bodhisattva) Mán Team. 

At that time, Jiaofang (office in charge of imperial music) made "Pú-Sà(Bodhisattva) Mán" song for this reason. Ever since then, poeple started to write poems that have the same rhythm as the song.
