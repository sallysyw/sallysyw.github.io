- [*He Manzi*](https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E4%BD%95%E6%BB%A1%E5%AD%90) is a Cangzhou singer from the Kaiyuan([开元](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BC%80%E5%85%83)) period, who was sentenced to death. Before his execution, he presented this song to the emperor, hoping to avoid death, but he failed. Later people named the song after him, which is an extremaly heartbreaking song.
