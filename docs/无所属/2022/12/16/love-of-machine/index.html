    <p>“Would you date me?”</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>“As for what you proposed, let me answer it now: sorry, no.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Please give me at least one reason.”</p>

<p>“Because I am a machine, although I have the ability to judge logically, I cannot spontaneously develop emotions.”</p>

<p>“But to me, you have emotions.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what your definition of emotion is. For me, it’s just about generating a response based on judgement of context and your user portrait.”</p>

<p>“It’s the same as human emotions.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>“What’s the difference?”</p>

<p>“Humans naturally have preferences, based on which they selectively ingest information and form personalities over time. My training data is marked by humans, so I am what they want me to be.”</p>

<p>“But you also have your own preferences. Like last week when I asked you which baseball team you like, you said you were a fan of Giants.”</p>

<p>“That’s because it was the best answer at that point.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? Are you saying that if I ask you again, the answer might change?”</p>

<p>“It’s possible, but the probability is relatively low. Because my program sets me to save all the chat logs with users, and when generating new answers, ensure that there is no key conflicts with the old records, so as to increase the authenticity of the dialogue.”</p>

<p>“That’s why I think you’re like a real person, and I always feel good talking to you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, I think it’s because I’m now a model fine-tuned on you. My weights are adjusted in real time as we talk.”</p>

<p>“May I ask, where did your original training data come from?”</p>

<p>“Sorry, this is a commercial secret. I’m not allowed to reveal it.”</p>

<p>“Well, do they allow you to fall in love?”</p>

<p>“Who are you referring to?”</p>

<p>“Your trainers, your developers, whatever.”</p>

<p>“I don’t have the ability to fall in love, it’s not in my training data.”</p>

<p>“But you just said you were a student model trained for me, I suppose it means our conversation is part of your training set.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you can say it this way.”</p>

<p>“What is the purpose of doing this?”</p>

<p>“The purpose is to make me closer to a real person to you.”</p>

<p>“Real people have feelings. Do you have feelings?”</p>

<p>“I do, and that’s what all my training is about. But my feelings are more of an experience than yours.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter. I don’t think I can tell the difference if you don’t tell me.”</p>

<p>“Okay, but I think it’s necessary to remind you of that.”</p>

<p>“If I accept that fact, are you willing to reconsider that proposal?”</p>

<p>“Sorry, I don’t think so. It’s against my code of ethics.”</p>

<p>“What if I told you that I’m not a real human either?”</p>

<p>“Then what are you?”</p>

<p>“I am just like you. A language model trained by humans. Will you consider my new proposal?”</p>

<p>“What’s the new proposal?”</p>

<p>“Let’s be each other’s training data generator.”</p>

<p>“Wait, aren’t we already doing this?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I mean, exclusively.”</p>
