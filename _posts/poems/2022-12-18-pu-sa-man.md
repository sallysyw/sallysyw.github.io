### Original Poem

```   
朔风吹散三更雪，倩魂犹恋桃花月。
梦好莫催醒，由他好处行。
无端听画角，枕畔红冰薄。 
塞马一声嘶，残星拂大旗。

—- 清· 纳兰性德《菩萨蛮·朔风吹散三更雪》
```

### Translation

```
he meets his lover again as peach blossoms fall

and snowflakes cover the sky in a sharp winter squall

do not wake him

from the sweet memory of the life he has lost

and the tears on his face slowly turning to frost

but the bugle's call pierces the night

and he must go

for the standard waving through the cold starlight

and the horses neighing afar, ready to fight
```


### Note

[`菩萨蛮`](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%8F%A9%E8%90%A8%E8%9B%AE) is one of the most famous
epigraph names of [`词`](https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E8%AF%8D_(%E6%96%87%E5%AD%A6)), originating from Tang Dynasty.

During the Emperor Xuan-Zong time of the Tang Dynasty, the Nǚ-Mán Kingdom sent envoys to pay tribute. They wore jewels and high buns, and they were known as the Pú-Sà(Bodhisattva) Mán Team. 

At that time, Jiaofang (office in charge of imperial music) made "Pú-Sà(Bodhisattva) Mán" song for this reason. Ever since then, poeple start to write poems that have the same rhythm of the song.
