### Original Poem

<poem_c>

微茫灯火共荒村，黄叶漫山雪拥门。
<br>
三十九年何限事，只留孤影伴黄昏。

### Translation

<poem_e>
Distant lights in the village,
<br>
fall leaves on the mountain,
<br>
snow lying at the door.
<br>
<br>
Of thirty nine years of unending change,
<br>
only my shadow at twilight remains.
</poem_e>
<br>


### Notes

Yuan Haowen([元好问](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_Haowen)) is a historian, a writer and a poet from the end of the Jin Dynasty to the period of the Mongolian Kingdom. He is mostly famous for writing poems about the turmoil during the years of war.

When this poem was written, Haowen was grieving the death of his mother, which was partly responsible for his depression. In addition, the poet had gone into exile overseas several times and witnessed the massacre of the Mongolian army. Although this poem is full of real scenes of barren villages, it was actually related to the poet's mood at that very moment.
